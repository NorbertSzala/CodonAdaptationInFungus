codonM	script in Pearl what count a codons in sequence (CDS seq needed)	Pearl
codon_frequencies_postia	table 9087x61 codons showing frequency of codons in sequence. There is lack of START and STOP codons	codonM (Pearl)
codons_NC_bulk	counted CAI frequency of codons in each sequence. File with _total ic summary to whole CDS	codonW
codons_NC_output counted some parameters like: NC, GC3s, GC, L_aa for each sequence. NC means how many different codons were used to code protein in that sequence. GC3s - number of synonymous codons with G or C in 3rd position. Laa- total number of synonymous and non-synomous codons
count_codons.py and count_codons.txt	first is script used to make count_codons.txt. It calculates how many codons were in sequence, translate it into DNA and sort it in TCAG order.
